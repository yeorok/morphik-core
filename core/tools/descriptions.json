Supports multimodal retrieval and scoping to specific folders. This tool uses vector similarity to find content fragments that best match the user's question.

The tool returns content items including text and images with relevance scores, with higher scores indicating better matches. It will not provide analysis or synthesis of the information, only the raw relevant fragments.",

For entity, path, and subgraph queries, if an ID is not found, it will try to match by label. For best results, consider using list_entities first to find exact entity IDs.
